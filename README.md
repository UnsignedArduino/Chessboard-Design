# Chessboard-Design

Design files for a magnetic-piece-tracking digital chessboard! WIP

This repository contains the Fusion CAD files for the Chessboard, including its pieces. 
For the PCB project, see [Chessboard-Hardware](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Hardware).
For the Arduino Nano firmware, see [Chessboard-Nano](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Nano).
For the Raspberry Pi firmware, see Chessboard-Pi.

## Notes

* The chess pieces were modified from [Mo's model](https://makerworld.com/en/models/216757-chess-set?from=search#profileId-388041).
* The pieces in [`Chess Pieces`](/Chess Pieces) all come from 
  [`All Chess Pieces v13.f3d`](/Chess Pieces/All Chess Pieces v13.f3d). The 
  other STEP and 3MF files are all derivations from that file. Due to the size
  of `*.f3d` files, they have only been included for the main assembly and for
  all the chess pieces combined.
* The [`Chessboard Design v35.f3z`](/Chessboard Design v35.f3z) file is 
  the work in progress part.

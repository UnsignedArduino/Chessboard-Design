# Chessboard-Design

Design files for a magnetic-piece-tracking digital chessboard! WIP

Note that the main assembly has not been finished and therefore has not been uploaded yet. 

This repository contains the Fusion CAD files for the Chessboard, including its pieces. 
For the PCB project, see [Chessboard-Hardware](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Hardware).
For the Arduino Nano firmware, see [Chessboard-Nano](https://github.com/UnsignedArduino/Chessboard-Nano).

## Notes

* The chess pieces were modified from [Mo's model](https://makerworld.com/en/models/216757-chess-set?from=search#profileId-388041).
